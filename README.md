# FB_Instant_Articles_wp
Added some functionality to Face Book Instant Articles plugin for wordpress
<img src="example.png" />
Hi, I fixed the plugin. Now there's a checkbox which filters unwanted posts from RSS Feed.
I know it's a bit ugly solution: I added a new table with ID of posts which will be displayed in the feed.
Just install updated the plugin. 
Thanks
